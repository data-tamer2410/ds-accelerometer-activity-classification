# Accelerometer Activity Classification
This project classifies human activities—idle, running, walking, and climbing stairs—using accelerometer data. By applying machine learning models like k-NN and Random Forest, we achieved high accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of these techniques in real-time activity recognition.

# Description
This project aimed to classify human activities—specifically idle, running, walking, and climbing stairs—using accelerometer data collected from mobile devices. The dataset was preprocessed to extract meaningful features, including mean and standard deviation across three axes of movement. Several machine learning models were employed, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
