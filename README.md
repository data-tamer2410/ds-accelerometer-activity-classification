# ds-accelerometer-activity-classification
This project classifies human activities—idle, running, walking, and climbing stairs—using accelerometer data. By applying machine learning models like k-NN and Random Forest, we achieved high accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of these techniques in real-time activity recognition.
